# MinJS

Do you want a programming language that you can compile into command blocks
Here is MinJS!

/!\ The features are limited, if you want to add one, let me know, I will happily add it

## Benefits:

1. Simplify

## Disadvantages:

1. Slow
2. Not optimized
3. Poorly coded

### Language Doc

(start at doc/syntaxe.md)

### Example:

```minjs
#!#imp;
   @import Run;
   @import Return;
   @Fimport Minecraft::Print;
#!#fun;
    fun<MyFunction>()-:
      #MyFunction#fun;
        NULL;
      #MyFunction#text;
        Print<"Hello, World!">;
    MyFunction_END
#!#text;
   Run MyFunction();
   Return;
```

(Chat Output): Hello World

A project that I made with this language is directly included here : /example_game
