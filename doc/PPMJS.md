## THIS IS AN OLD FEATURE, SO I'LL JUST ONLY PUT THE S_PPvar.js doc

### S_PPvar

Syntaxe:

```minjs
String PPvar [NAME] = "NAME"
```

NAME=String; name of the variable

It's a variable that is declared before compilation, just replace one argument with %[NAME], and it will be replaced by the string
