### ALL FUNCTION WILL BE EXECUTED (ONLY ON PreProcessing)! (EVEN IF YOU DON'T RUN IT) (NOT IN THE GAME)

### THE COMPILER READS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, SO A FUNCTION CANNOT CALL HIMSELF OR A BOTTOM FUNCTION

### I'M FRENCH, AND I DON'T USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE (except for syntaxe.md), SO IF MY ENGLISH IS BAD, THAT'S NORMAL
